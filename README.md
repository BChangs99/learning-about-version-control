# learning-about-version-control

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

The thing I like most about version control is the ability to keep a version history of all my files.

I really don't like dealing with merge conflicts, especially when there's a lot of code and a lot of it isn't even what I wrote as it gets really difficult keeping
both versions of code together without communicating with the other person.
